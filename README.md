# Restaurant Tweet Sentiment Analysis 

A Python Jupyter notebook to analyze how restaurants are doing during the Corona Crisis by performing sentiment analysis on tweets.

For this project, our team scraped 5,000 tweets for 4 restaurants (Applebee's, Chipotle, Denny's, Olive Garden) in different time frames of COVID-19 using a tweet scraper in Python. The three timeframes are defined as Jan 1 – 15th: pre Covid-19; March 15 – 29th: initial COVID-19 Response; April 6 – 20th: settled into COVID-19 Pandemic. We deployed sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and SEntiment Reasoner) on tweets and classified tweets as positive, negative, and neutral. Additionally, we developed data visualizations in Python and provided insights on how customers’ perceptions changed during COVID-19 and suggestions on where and how restaurants needed to improve.
